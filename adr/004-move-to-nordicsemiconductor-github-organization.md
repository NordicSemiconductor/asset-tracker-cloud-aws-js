# ADR 004: Move to Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization

In February 2021, the project was moved from the `Bifravst` GitHub organization
to the official Nordic Semiconductor GitHub organization
(`Nordic Semiconductor`). This move was caused by the
[promotion of the Bifravst project into an official Nordic Semiconductor open-source project](https://github.com/bifravst/bifravst/issues/56)
with the release of the firmware in
[nRF Connect SDK](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf) as
[nRF9160: Asset Tracker v2](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/1.5.0/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2/README.html)
application.

The project is renamed to _nRF Asset Tracker_.
